/*
We start by filtering through collection using Array.filter().
Next, we map through all keys and return Boolean values based on the check conditions: both the key and its 
corresponding value must exist within the object we are filtering through.
Then we reduce the mapped Boolean values to a single Boolean that indicates whether all srcKeys pass the conditions checked above.
This single Boolean will be used to filter through the collection.
