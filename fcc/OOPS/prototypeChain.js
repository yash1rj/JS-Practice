// All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype.
// Also, an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object.

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

console.log(typeof Bird.prototype); // => object

// Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! 
// In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:

console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype));
// returns true

// How is this useful?

let duck = new Bird("Donald");

console.log(duck.hasOwnProperty("name")); // => true

// The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be 
// accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck. 
// This is an example of the prototype chain.

// In this prototype chain, Bird is the supertype for duck, 
// while duck is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck.

// Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. 
// Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.
