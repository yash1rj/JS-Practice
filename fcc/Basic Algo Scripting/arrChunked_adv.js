/*
Firstly, we create a variable. newArr is an empty array which we will push to.
Our while loop loops until the length of the array in our test is not 0.
Inside our loop, we push to the newArr array using arr.splice(0, size).
For each iteration of while loop, it deletes size number of elements from the front of arr and push them as an array to newArr.
Finally, we return the value of newArr.
