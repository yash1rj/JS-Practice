/*
First we start off with a simple if statement to determine one of three outcomesâ€¦
If our string length is greater than the num we want to truncate at, and our truncate 
point is at least three characters or more into the string, we return a slice of our string starting at character 0, 
  and ending at num - 3. We then append our '...' to the end of the string.
However, if our string length is greater than the num but num is within the first three characters, we donâ€™t have to 
count our dots as characters. Therefore, we return the same string as above, with one difference: The endpoint of our 
slice is now just num.
Finally, if none of the above situations are true, it means our string length is less than our truncation num. 
Therefore, we can just return the string.
